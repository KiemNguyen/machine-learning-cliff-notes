# Machine Learning Cliff Notes

My notes on machine learning models, tips and best practices from my working experience, trainings, conferences, MOOCs and blogs. I will keep updating these Jupyter notebooks. Please feel free to let me know if you find something that is unclear. Thank you and Happy learning.
